Daily Stand-up 2024-11-28

Ferenc 
Done: I have finished the first_page and made it mobile friendly.
Is Doing: Trying to finish the cards in the "uses" section.
Problems: Lots of work outside of school which lowers the amount of time I have in the project but no problems yet.


James 
Done: Has done lots of work in the branches how-it-works and the footer.
Is Doing: Doing some work with the styling of the how-it-works section.
Problems: I'm not happy with the current styling of the how-it-works section, particularly how the background image looksâ€”it doesn't blend as well as I'd like with the content. However, refining the background image and its integration is the next step in the process, and I'll focus on improving it to ensure the section is both visually appealing and cohesive with the rest of the design.
