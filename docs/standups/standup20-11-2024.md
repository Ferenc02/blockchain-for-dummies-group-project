# Daily Stand-up 2024-11-20

### **Ferenc**  
- **Done**: What he has done today is to implement product structure in GitHub for the agile development in GitHub.  
- **Doing**: Focus on the planning poker points, make sure we are up-to-date with the plan.  
- **Problems**: Uncertainty of the agile part of this project.  

### **Arwin**  
- **Done**: Arwin has been thinking a bit about the website that we are going to build, maybe 5 pages is too many pages to fill with content because the BC-tech can be explained shorter than that. Focus on important content and less BS-words.  
- **Doing**: Put more work on the wireframe so we have a clear goal with website design.  
- **Problems**: One problem is that he thinks the wireframe needs to be done ASAP.  

### **James**  
- **Done**: Has been thinking about the project as a whole, thinking about how we can make the project more clear and have a good "footwork" to go forward.  
- **Doing**: Doing more research on SCRUM methods and seeing how we can get more organized.  
- **Problems**: Uncertain on what task he has responsibility for.  

### **Topias**  
- **Done**: Not much so far other than trying to get a better understanding of SCRUM.  
- **Doing**: Getting more organized and marking down most important to-do list.  
- **Problems**: Has had issues understanding how we are supposed to work with SCRUM in this school exercise because he doesn't have any experience in working agile with SCRUM.
